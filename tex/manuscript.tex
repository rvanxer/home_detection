\abstract{
Estimation of a person’s most prominent location (MPL), such as home or work location, from large-scale location-based services (LBS) data from smartphones is a common task in many applications in quantitative human mobility assessment. However, commonly used  MPL detection methods are often arbitrary and unexamined. In this study, we compare \#\# MPL detection algorithms on high-quality LBS data using a few performance metrics. We discuss the conceptual and empirical differences between these methods and comment on their use cases. We find that … method works the best when …. Our results will be helpful for human mobility analysis tasks such as …

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}
% Background
MPL detection plays an essential role in many () studies such as (). Details about the role.

% Challenges and research gaps
Despite its significance, little attention has been paid on ensuring the reliability of the estimated MPLs. In literature, researchers often state their MPL detection methods plainly without thorough validation, resulting in doubts about the validity of the subsequent findings based on the estimated MPLs.

In this paper, we do ... Study Overview. Our contributions are three-fold:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Contrib 1
    \item Contrib 2
    \item Contrib 3
\end{enumerate}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2. Section 3. Section 4. Section 5.

\subsection{Related work}

In this section, we review different home location detection algorithms and their applications.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shen et al. (2014) summarized the different types of home detection algorithms \cite{Shen2014}.
\end{itemize}

% We should directly go with the study design, the GPS data description can be put in the Result section
\section{Data and methods}

\subsection{GPS data description}
This is the section for the GPS data description.

\subsubsection{Data filtering}

\subsection{Performance metrics}

\subsubsection{Residential detection rate}

\subsubsection{Proximity to daily data}
% Definition
This metric makes use of the idea that a home location should be the origin/destination of one’s daily trips. Given a person’s identified “home location” and observed trajectories (i.e., a sequence of coordinates), we calculate the distance between the “home location” and trajectory  for each day, then take the average of these distances as its proximity to daily data.

% A small example
The following figure (to be added) shows an example of how to obtain this metric. In the example, there are two candidate home locations: a red dot and a green cross.  The red one only falls on the trajectory of day 1 and is far away from the trajectories for other days. In this case, the conjecture is that a red dot is just a place where this person hung out during day 0’s evening and the green cross is more likely to be his/her home location.

% More implication
This metric, not only can be used to compare different MPL detection methods but can also serve as a data cleaning criterion: if no point is found to have low proximity to daily data, this means we are unlikely to identify the home location and we may remove this person’s data from the analyses.

\subsubsection{Proximity to home-based trips}

\begin{equation}
    \gamma(A) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M \left[ \min_{k\in\{\text{orig},\text{dest}\}} \lVert \mathbf{x}_{i_j}^{\text{home}} - \mathbf{x}_j^k \rVert_2 \right]
\end{equation}

Here, $M$ is the total number of trips across all days, $i_j$ is $i^{th}$ user's $j^{th}$ trip.
